# Code Review: Resonate CLI Player

## Overview
This is a Swift package implementing CLI players for the Resonate Protocol audio streaming system. The codebase includes three executable targets: a CLI player with TUI interface, an audio test utility, and a simple test client. The code demonstrates proper usage of the `ResonateKit` framework for synchronized multi-room audio playback.

## Architecture Assessment
The codebase follows good Swift practices with proper separation of concerns:
- **CLIPlayer**: Main interactive player with TUI
- **AudioTest**: Simple PCM audio playback test
- **SimpleTest**: Non-interactive connection test

## Detailed Review

### Package.swift
**Lines 1-31**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clean package definition with appropriate Swift 6.0 tools version
- Proper platform targeting (macOS 14+)
- Good separation of executable targets
- Local dependency reference is appropriate for examples

### CLIPlayer/main.swift
**Lines 1-47**

⚠️ **Issues:**
- **Line 6**: Using top-level async code without `@main` struct - this works but is less conventional for Swift 6.0
- **Lines 24-40**: Discovery logic mixed with argument parsing creates complex flow
- **Line 43**: Force unwrapping `serverURL!` without additional safety check

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clean argument parsing logic
- Good user feedback during discovery
- Proper error handling with exit codes

**Recommendations:**
```swift
// Consider wrapping in @main struct for better Swift 6 compliance
@main
struct CLIPlayerMain {
    static func main() async {
        // ... existing code
    }
}
```

### CLIPlayer/CLIPlayer.swift
**Lines 1-371**

#### Core Player Logic (Lines 6-181)

✅ **Strengths:**
- Well-structured class with proper task management
- Good separation between TUI and non-TUI modes
- Proper cleanup in `deinit`
- Comprehensive audio format support (lines 26-36)

⚠️ **Potential Issues:**
- **Lines 47-53**: Multiple concurrent tasks created without explicit coordination
- **Line 62**: `Task.detached` usage breaks actor isolation - could cause race conditions
- **Lines 138-143**: `monitorStats` function is essentially empty but still runs
- **Line 177**: Weak capture in Task might not prevent retain cycles as intended

**Critical Issue - Line 62-64:**
```swift
let commandTask = Task.detached { [display] in
    await CLIPlayer.runCommandLoopStatic(client: client, display: display)
}
```
This breaks MainActor isolation and could cause data races when accessing `client` from different contexts.

#### Event Handling (Lines 78-135)

✅ **Strengths:**
- Comprehensive event handling
- Good separation between TUI and logging modes
- Proper async iteration over event stream

⚠️ **Minor Issues:**
- **Lines 103-105**: Inconsistent event logging (some events only log in non-TUI mode)
- **Lines 121-128**: Artwork and visualizer events logged but not used

#### StatusDisplay Actor (Lines 209-371)

✅ **Strengths:**
- Proper use of `actor` for thread-safe state management
- Rich terminal UI with ANSI escape codes
- Good visual feedback with colors and progress bars
- Comprehensive status information display

⚠️ **Issues:**
- **Lines 237-242**: Busy loop with 100ms sleep - could be more efficient
- **Line 236**: `fflush(stdout)` called from within actor - potential concurrency issue
- **Lines 283-332**: Very long render function could benefit from decomposition

**Performance Concern:**
The display updates every 100ms regardless of whether data has changed, which is inefficient.

### AudioTest/main.swift
**Lines 1-58**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Good demonstration of direct PCM playback
- Proper chunking strategy
- Clear error handling and user feedback
- Appropriate use of `@main`

⚠️ **Issues:**
- **Line 11**: Hardcoded file path "sample-3s.pcm" - should be configurable
- **Line 50**: Fixed 10ms delay might not be optimal for all systems
- **Line 54**: Magic number "4" seconds for wait time

**Suggestion:**
```swift
// Make file path configurable
let filePath = CommandLine.arguments.count > 1 ? CommandLine.arguments[1] : "sample-3s.pcm"
let fileURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: filePath)
```

### SimpleTest/main.swift
**Lines 1-72**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Clean, focused implementation
- Good command-line argument handling
- Proper async/await usage
- Comprehensive event monitoring

⚠️ **Minor Issues:**
- **Line 24**: Single format support might be too limiting for testing
- **Lines 51-52**: Some events ignored with `default: break`

## Security Considerations

1. **Line 11 (AudioTest)**: File path input is not validated - could lead to path traversal
2. **WebSocket URLs**: No validation of server certificates in examples
3. **Command input**: Basic input parsing without sanitization

## Performance Considerations

1. **Buffer sizes**: 2MB buffer (line 19 CLIPlayer, line 22 SimpleTest) seems reasonable but not configurable
2. **Display updates**: 100ms refresh rate might be excessive
3. **Task spawning**: Multiple concurrent tasks without resource limits

## Code Quality Issues

### High Priority
- Fix MainActor isolation violation in CLIPlayer (line 62)
- Remove or implement `monitorStats` function
- Add proper error handling for force unwrap (CLIPlayer/main.swift line 43)

### Medium Priority
- Make file paths configurable in AudioTest
- Decompose large render function in StatusDisplay
- Add input validation for file operations

### Low Priority
- Consider using more structured argument parsing
- Add configuration file support
- Improve code documentation

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate fixes needed:**
   ```swift
   // Fix MainActor isolation
   private func runCommandLoop(client: ResonateClient) async {
       // Move back to MainActor context instead of Task.detached
   }
   ```

2. **Architecture improvements:**
   - Consider using Combine or AsyncStream for display updates instead of polling
   - Implement proper configuration management
   - Add structured logging

3. **Testing considerations:**
   - The examples lack error injection testing
   - Network failure scenarios not well handled
   - Audio format negotiation edge cases not covered

## Overall Assessment

This is a well-structured example demonstrating ResonateKit usage with good separation of concerns and proper Swift concurrency usage in most areas. The main issues are around MainActor isolation violations and some performance inefficiencies in the display system. The code serves its purpose as an example but would need hardening for production use.

**Rating: B+** - Good example code with some concurrency safety issues that need addressing.
